From Static to Dynamic: How Fluid Interfaces and Typography Enhance Your Design System


# Fluid Interfaces with Design Tokens
This project demonstrates the use of design tokens for creating fluid interfaces and typography. Design tokens are a way to abstract visual properties such as color, typography, spacing, etc. into reusable and consistent variables that can be used across an entire design system.


## Usage
This project includes a demo of a fluid interface and typography using design tokens. 
The design tokens are defined in the tokens folder and include variables for colors, typography, spacing, and more.

To see the tokens in action, open the project page in your browser. 
You'll see a demo interface with different components that showcase the use of design tokens with fluid values.
